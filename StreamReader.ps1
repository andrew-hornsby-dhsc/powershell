        .SYNOPSIS
            Read text file(s) and parse them line-by-line using Stream Reader
            Much more memory-friendly and faster than Get-Content

        .NOTES
            Created By Jason Svatos
            Still working on this script - created 1/14/2016.
            -Pipeline input of arrays not working
            -Tail not working yet

        .DESCRIPTION
            Using StreamReader - you are using the .NET framework to read files
            This allows you to read files in text (-ReadToEnd) or line-by-line (default).
            This is also faster as Get-Content reads files into memory first. That is fine unless you have
            a large file which takes up too much memory - that's where this will come in handy.
            Using -ReadToEnd switch will make reading larger files 5x-10x faster.

        .EXAMPLE
            StreamReader -Files "c:\temp\text.txt" -Count
            Will read all lines of c:\temp\text.txt and return the amount of lines

        .EXAMPLE
            $files = @("c:\temp\test.txt", "c:\temp\two.txt")
            $files | StreamReader
            Will run through all lines in both files in the $files array

        .EXAMPLE
            StreamReader -Files "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\ReportingEvents.log" -readToEnd
            This will read in the file ReportingEvents.log file for Windows Update. This will read the file to the end without
            going line-by-line. If you use measure command, you will notice it reads much faster than get-content
            Measure-Command -Expression {StreamReader -Files "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\ReportingEvents.log" -readToEnd}
            vs
            Measure-Command -Expression {Get-Content "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\ReportingEvents.log"}

        .PARAMETER Files
            [Mandatory] String or Array - Path to text file(s) to process for this command.

        .PARAMETER List
            [SWITCH] Default Selection, is not necessary to declare.
            Use to list the contents of the file(s) input from $Files without doing anything to them.
            This will read the file(s) line-by-line and return each line separately.

        .PARAMETER Count
            [SWITCH] Use to only return the amount of lines in the file(s)

        .PARAMETER ReadToEnd
            [SWITCH] Use to read the files to the end without parsing Line-By-Line.

        .PARAMETER Tail
            [INT] Read # amount of lines from end of file
            Does not work yet

        .PARAMETER Head
            [INT] Read # amount of lines from top of file

        .PARAMETER SkipLines
            [INT] Skip # amount of lines from top of file
            This will only work with Head, List, and Count
