        .SYNOPSIS
            Read text file(s) and parse them line-by-line using Stream Reader
            Much more memory-friendly and faster than Get-Content

            -Tail not working yet

        .DESCRIPTION
            Using StreamReader - you are using the .NET framework to read files
            This allows you to read files in text (-ReadToEnd) or line-by-line (default).
            This is also faster as Get-Content reads files into memory first. That is fine unless you have
            a large file which takes up too much memory - that's where this will come in handy.
            Using -ReadToEnd switch will make reading larger files 5x-10x faster.

        .EXAMPLE
            StreamReader -Files "c:\temp\text.txt" -Count
            Will read all lines of c:\temp\text.txt and return the amount of lines

        .EXAMPLE
            $files = @("c:\temp\test.txt", "c:\temp\two.txt")
            $files | StreamReader
            Will run through all lines in both files in the $files array

        .EXAMPLE
            StreamReader -Files "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\ReportingEvents.log" -readToEnd
            This will read in the file ReportingEvents.log file for Windows Update. This will read the file to the end without
            going line-by-line. If you use measure command, you will notice it reads much faster than get-content
            Measure-Command -Expression {StreamReader -Files "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\ReportingEvents.log" -readToEnd}
            vs
            Measure-Command -Expression {Get-Content "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\ReportingEvents.log"}
